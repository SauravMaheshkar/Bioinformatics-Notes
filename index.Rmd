# Introduction {#intro}

The state of technology in bioinformatics is frantically moving forward. Datasets are growing exponentially and what seemed to be huge experiments are nothing more than proof's of concepts now. 

We started out with the 10k SNP chip and now we have 3 million SNP arrays. We're talking about 30 billion nucleotide reads per sample. Such computations obviously take place on computers and there's a huge need of efficient algorithms to make sense of such amounts of data. 

We have a lot of publicly available tools which aim to tackle very **specific** problems and are mostly not ideal for automated processes. In the recent years the statistical programming language **R** has become increasingly popular in genomic data analysis (some might even argue it's the *de facto* standard). If you want a primer on R kindly visit Chapter 1 which briefly covers the language (not exhaustive)
